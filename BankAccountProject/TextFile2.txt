maybe outline it like this:

welcome to the bank
generic language

ask first about checking or saving (or exit the bank)
THEN create instance for relevant derived class

print total on deposit
print total in specific account (c or s)

ask if they want to deposit, withdraw, return to main menu

repeat until main menu choice is to leave the bank
